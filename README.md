# BluThrift Backend
This project is the backend implementation for BluThrift, an
app being developed by students at the University of Michigan as a part of
the student led organization VOID Tech. 
This project requires Node.js and once installed it requires the dependency 
npm ci. It uses PostgresSQL as the database and you can launch the database 
in Docker Desktop. 
This project is intended to be used along with the corresponding repo for
frontend development in the VOID Tech UM github for the BluThrift app.
